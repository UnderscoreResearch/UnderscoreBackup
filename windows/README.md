Underscore Research is installed
================================

What this means is that it is installed and added to you command link path.

If you do not know what that means, this application is not for you. For now it has no GUI component so see.

See the main [README](../README.md) for configuration instructions.

For Windows you have the option of two binaries to run.

    underscorebackup.exe
    
Which is a Windows console appication which means that you can execute it from power shell or
the windows command line and see its output. Then there is also the

    underscorebackup-gui.exe
    
This application is compiled as a GUI application which means that if you want to see its output
you need to redirect it to a file while launching it. This application can also not accept any input.
It can be useful for actually running a continuous backup in the backgrount though without having
to have a command window open showing its output.
